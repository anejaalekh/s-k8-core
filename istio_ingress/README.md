Istio is a completely open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. It is also a platform, including APIs that let it integrate into any logging platform, or telemetry or policy system. Istioâ€™s diverse feature set lets you successfully, and efficiently, run a distributed microservice architecture, and provides a uniform way to secure, connect, and monitor microservices. Istio can also be used a Ingress for kubernetes. Istio can also be used with knative for Ingress purposes.

Istio features: 

1. Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic.

2. Fine-grained control of traffic behavior with rich routing rules, retries, failovers, and fault injection.

3. A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access controls, rate limits and quotas.

4. Automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within a cluster, including cluster ingress and egress.

5. Secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with strong identity-based authentication and authorization.
